<summary>2021-01-02 22:04:22 - Improving DGA-Based Malicious Domain Classifiers for Malware Defense with Adversarial Machine Learning</summary>

- *Ibrahim Yilmaz, Ambareen Siraj, Denis Ulybyshev*

- `2101.00521v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00521v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00521v1)

> Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are used by adversaries to establish Command and Control (C\&C) server communications during cyber attacks. Blacklists of known/identified C\&C domains are often used as one of the defense mechanisms. However, since blacklists are static and generated by signature-based approaches, they can neither keep up nor detect never-seen-before malicious domain names. Due to this shortcoming of blacklist domain checking, machine learning algorithms have been used to address the problem to some extent. However, when training is performed with limited datasets, the algorithms are likely to fail in detecting new DGA variants. To mitigate this weakness, we successfully applied a DGA-based malicious domain classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method with a novel feature engineering technique. Our model's performance shows a higher level of accuracy compared to a previously reported model from prior research. Additionally, we propose a new method using adversarial machine learning to generate never-before-seen malware-related domain families that can be used to illustrate the shortcomings of machine learning algorithms in this regard. Next, we augment the training dataset with new samples such that it makes training of the machine learning models more effective in detecting never-before-seen malicious domain name variants. Finally, to protect blacklists of malicious domain names from disclosure and tampering, we devise secure data containers that store blacklists and guarantee their protection against adversarial access and modifications.

<summary>2021-01-13 05:46:44 - Towards Interpretable Ensemble Learning for Image-based Malware Detection</summary>

- *Yuzhou Lin, Xiaolin Chang*

- `2101.04889v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04889v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04889v1)

> Deep learning (DL) models for image-based malware detection have exhibited their capability in producing high prediction accuracy. But model interpretability is posing challenges to their widespread application in security and safety-critical application domains. This paper aims for designing an Interpretable Ensemble learning approach for image-based Malware Detection (IEMD). We first propose a Selective Deep Ensemble Learning-based (SDEL) detector and then design an Ensemble Deep Taylor Decomposition (EDTD) approach, which can give the pixel-level explanation to SDEL detector outputs. Furthermore, we develop formulas for calculating fidelity, robustness and expressiveness on pixel-level heatmaps in order to assess the quality of EDTD explanation. With EDTD explanation, we develop a novel Interpretable Dropout approach (IDrop), which establishes IEMD by training SDEL detector. Experiment results exhibit the better explanation of our EDTD than the previous explanation methods for image-based malware detection. Besides, experiment results indicate that IEMD achieves a higher detection accuracy up to 99.87% while exhibiting interpretability with high quality of prediction results. Moreover, experiment results indicate that IEMD interpretability increases with the increasing detection accuracy during the construction of IEMD. This consistency suggests that IDrop can mitigate the tradeoff between model interpretability and detection accuracy.

- *Cengiz Acarturk, Melih Sirlanci, Pinar Gurkan Balikcioglu, Deniz Demirci, Nazenin Sahin, Ozge Acar Kucuk*

- `2101.05646v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05646v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05646v1)

> Malicious software threats and their detection have been gaining importance as a subdomain of information security due to the expansion of ICT applications in daily settings. A major challenge in designing and developing anti-malware systems is the coverage of the detection, particularly the development of dynamic analysis methods that can detect polymorphic and metamorphic malware efficiently. In the present study, we propose a methodological framework for detecting malicious code by analyzing run trace outputs by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We developed models of run traces of malicious and benign Portable Executable (PE) files. We created our dataset from run trace outputs obtained from dynamic analysis of PE files. The obtained dataset was in the instruction format as a sequence and was called Instruction as a Sequence Model (ISM). By splitting the first dataset into basic blocks, we obtained the second one called Basic Block as a Sequence Model (BSM). The experiments showed that the ISM achieved an accuracy of 87.51% and a false positive rate of 18.34%, while BSM achieved an accuracy of 99.26% and a false positive rate of 2.62%.

- *Tajuddin Manhar Mohammed, Lakshmanan Nataraj, Satish Chikkagoudar, Shivkumar Chandrasekaran, B. S. Manjunath*

- `2101.10578v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10578v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10578v1)

> We propose a novel method to detect and visualize malware through image classification. The executable binaries are represented as grayscale images obtained from the count of N-grams (N=2) of bytes in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and a neural network is trained for malware detection. A shallow neural network is trained for classification, and its accuracy is compared with deep-network architectures such as ResNet that are trained using transfer learning. Neither dis-assembly nor behavioral analysis of malware is required for these methods. Motivated by the visual similarity of these images for different malware families, we compare our deep neural network models with standard image features like GIST descriptors to evaluate the performance. A joint feature measure is proposed to combine different features using error analysis to get an accurate ensemble model for improved classification performance. A new dataset called MaleX which contains around 1 million malware and benign Windows executable samples is created for large-scale malware detection and classification experiments. Experimental results are quite promising with 96% binary classification accuracy on MaleX. The proposed model is also able to generalize well on larger unseen malware samples and the results compare favorably with state-of-the-art static analysis-based malware detection algorithms.

<summary>2021-01-27 16:45:57 - Robust Android Malware Detection System against Adversarial Attacks using Q-Learning</summary>

- *Hemant Rathore, Sanjay K. Sahay, Piyush Nikam, Mohit Sewak*

- `2101.12031v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12031v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12031v1)

> The current state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems are based on machine learning and deep learning models. Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against adversarial attacks. For this purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in the adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior do not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across all the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision tree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold to 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.

<summary>2021-02-01 15:16:18 - DRLDO: A novel DRL based De-ObfuscationSystem for Defense against Metamorphic Malware</summary>

- *Mohit Sewak, Sanjay K. Sahay, Hemant Rathore*

- `2102.00898v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00898v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00898v1)

> In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to normalize metamorphic and obfuscated malware down at the opcode level and hence create an advanced metamorphic malware de-obfuscation and defense system. We name this system DRLDO, for Deep Reinforcement Learning based De-Obfuscator. With the inclusion of the DRLDO as a sub-component, an existing Intrusion Detection System could be augmented with defensive capabilities against 'zero-day' attacks from obfuscated and metamorphic variants of existing malware. This gains importance, not only because there exists no system to date that uses advanced DRL to intelligently and automatically normalize obfuscation down even to the opcode level, but also because the DRLDO system does not mandate any changes to the existing IDS. The DRLDO system does not even mandate the IDS' classifier to be retrained with any new dataset containing obfuscated samples. Hence DRLDO could be easily retrofitted into any existing IDS deployment. We designed, developed, and conducted experiments on the system to evaluate the same against multiple-simultaneous attacks from obfuscations generated from malware samples from a standardized dataset that contains multiple generations of malware. Experimental results prove that DRLDO was able to successfully make the otherwise un-detectable obfuscated variants of the malware detectable by an existing pre-trained malware classifier. The detection probability was raised well above the cut-off mark to 0.6 for the classifier to detect the obfuscated malware unambiguously. Further, the de-obfuscated variants generated by DRLDO achieved a very high correlation (of 0.99) with the base malware. This observation validates that the DRLDO system is actually learning to de-obfuscate and not exploiting a trivial trick.

<summary>2021-02-04 09:31:56 - In Nomine Function: Naming Functions in Stripped Binaries with Neural Networks</summary>

- *Fiorella Artuso, Giuseppe Antonio Di Luna, Luca Massarelli, Leonardo Querzoni*

- `1912.07946v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07946v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07946v3)

> In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to an assembly function a string of words that would likely be assigned by a human reverse engineer. We formally and precisely define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define the problem, we provide reasonable justifications for the choices that we made for the design of training and the tests. We performed an analysis on a large real-world corpora constituted by nearly 9 millions of functions taken from more than 22k softwares. In such framework we test baselines coming from the field of Natural Language Processing (e.g., Seq2Seq networks and Transformer). Interestingly, our evaluation shows promising results beating the state-of-the-art and reaching good performance. We investigate the applicability of tine-tuning (i.e., taking a model already trained on a large generic corpora and retraining it for a specific task). Such technique is popular and well-known in the NLP field. Our results confirm that fine-tuning is effective even when neural networks are applied to binaries. We show that a model, pre-trained on the aforementioned corpora, when fine-tuned has higher performances on specific domains (such as predicting names in system utilites, malware, etc).

<summary>2021-02-08 07:43:45 - Adversarial Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks in Facial Recognition Domain</summary>

- *Yigit Alparslan, Ken Alparslan, Jeremy Keim-Shenk, Shweta Khade, Rachel Greenstadt*

- `2001.11137v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11137v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11137v3)

> Numerous recent studies have demonstrated how Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by adversarial examples, in which an attacker adds perturbations to an original sample, causing the classifier to misclassify the sample. Adversarial attacks that render DNNs vulnerable in real life represent a serious threat in autonomous vehicles, malware filters, or biometric authentication systems. In this paper, we apply Fast Gradient Sign Method to introduce perturbations to a facial image dataset and then test the output on a different classifier that we trained ourselves, to analyze transferability of this method. Next, we craft a variety of different black-box attack algorithms on a facial image dataset assuming minimal adversarial knowledge, to further assess the robustness of DNNs in facial recognition. While experimenting with different image distortion techniques, we focus on modifying single optimal pixels by a large amount, or modifying all pixels by a smaller amount, or combining these two attack approaches. While our single-pixel attacks achieved about a 15% average decrease in classifier confidence level for the actual class, the all-pixel attacks were more successful and achieved up to an 84% average decrease in confidence, along with an 81.6% misclassification rate, in the case of the attack that we tested with the highest levels of perturbation. Even with these high levels of perturbation, the face images remained identifiable to a human. Understanding how these noised and perturbed images baffle the classification algorithms can yield valuable advances in the training of DNNs against defense-aware adversarial attacks, as well as adaptive noise reduction techniques. We hope our research may help to advance the study of adversarial attacks on DNNs and defensive mechanisms to counteract them, particularly in the facial recognition domain.

> Malware classification is an important and challenging problem in information security. Modern malware classification techniques rely on machine learning models that can be trained on features such as opcode sequences, API calls, and byte $n$-grams, among many others. In this research, we consider opcode features. We implement hybrid machine learning techniques, where we engineer feature vectors by training hidden Markov models -- a technique that we refer to as HMM2Vec -- and Word2Vec embeddings on these opcode sequences. The resulting HMM2Vec and Word2Vec embedding vectors are then used as features for classification algorithms. Specifically, we consider support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. We conduct substantial experiments over a variety of malware families. Our experiments extend well beyond any previous work in this field.

> In recent years we have witnessed an increase in cyber threats and malicious software attacks on different platforms with important consequences to persons and businesses. It has become critical to find automated machine learning techniques to proactively defend against malware. Transformers, a category of attention-based deep learning techniques, have recently shown impressive results in solving different tasks mainly related to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose the use of a Transformers' architecture to automatically detect malicious software. We propose a model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which performs a static analysis on the source code of Android applications using preprocessed features to characterize existing malware and classify it into different representative malware categories. The obtained results are promising and show the high performance obtained by Transformer-based models for malicious software detection.

> The variety of services and functionality offered by various cloud service providers (CSP) have exploded lately. Utilizing such services has created numerous opportunities for enterprises infrastructure to become cloud-based and, in turn, assisted the enterprises to easily and flexibly offer services to their customers. The practice of renting out access to servers to clients for computing and storage purposes is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The popularity of IaaS has led to serious and critical concerns with respect to the cyber security and privacy. In particular, malware is often leveraged by malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive data or to obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware detection for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with numerous methods being proposed and deployed. In this paper, we present online malware detection based on process level performance metrics, and analyze the effectiveness of different baseline machine learning models including, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), KNearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosted Classifier (GBC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our analysis conclude that neural network models can most accurately detect the impact malware have on the process level features of virtual machines in the cloud, and therefore are best suited to detect them. Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running different families of malware (collected from VirusTotal) in a live cloud environment and collecting the process level features.

- `2105.11593v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11593v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11593v1)

> With the growing popularity of Android devices, Android malware is seriously threatening the safety of users. Although such threats can be detected by deep learning as a service (DLaaS), deep neural networks as the weakest part of DLaaS are often deceived by the adversarial samples elaborated by attackers. In this paper, we propose a new semi-black-box attack framework called one-feature-each-iteration (OFEI) to craft Android adversarial samples. This framework modifies as few features as possible and requires less classifier information to fool the classifier. We conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate our OFEI framework by comparing it with the benchmark methods JSMF, GenAttack and pointwise attack. The experimental results show that our OFEI has a higher misclassification rate of 98.25%. Furthermore, OFEI can extend the traditional white-box attack methods in the image field, such as fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and DeepFool, to craft adversarial samples for Android. Finally, to enhance the security of DLaaS, we use two uncertainties of the Bayesian neural network to construct the combined uncertainty, which is used to detect adversarial samples and achieves a high detection rate of 99.28%.

> Android malware is one of the most dangerous threats on the internet, and it's been on the rise for several years. Despite significant efforts in detecting and classifying android malware from innocuous android applications, there is still a long way to go. As a result, there is a need to provide a basic understanding of the behavior displayed by the most common Android malware categories and families. Each Android malware family and category has a distinct objective. As a result, it has impacted every corporate area, including healthcare, banking, transportation, government, and e-commerce. In this paper, we presented two machine-learning approaches for Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware: one for detecting and identifying Android Malware Categories and the other for detecting and identifying Android Malware Families, which was accomplished by analyzing a massive malware dataset with 14 prominent malware categories and 180 prominent malware families of CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 dataset on Dynamic Layers. Our approach achieves in Android Malware Category detection more than 96 % accurate and achieves in Android Malware Family detection more than 99% accurate. Our approach provides a method for high-accuracy Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware while also shortening the time required to analyze smartphone malware.

> Android is among the most targeted platform by attackers. While attackers are improving their techniques, traditional solutions based on static and dynamic analysis have been also evolving. In addition to the application code, Android applications have some metadata that could be useful for security analysis of applications. Unlike traditional application distribution mechanisms, Android applications are distributed centrally in mobile markets. Therefore, beside application packages, such markets contain app information provided by app developers and app users. The availability of such useful textual data together with the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to process and understand textual data has encouraged researchers to investigate the use of NLP techniques in Android security. Especially, security solutions based on NLP have accelerated in the last 5 years and proven to be useful. This study reviews these proposals and aim to explore possible research directions for future studies by presenting state-of-the-art in this domain. We mainly focus on NLP-based solutions under four categories: description-to-behaviour fidelity, description generation, privacy and malware detection.

> Malicious activities in cyberspace have gone further than simply hacking machines and spreading viruses. It has become a challenge for a nations survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification framework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification (DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by fusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it against the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented in two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and fine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed classification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%, F-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.

> How can we identify similar repositories and clusters among a large online archive, such as GitHub? Determiningrepository similarity is an essential building block in studying the dynamics and the evolution of such software ecosystems. The key challenge is to determine the right representation for the diverse repository features in a way that: (a) it captures all aspects of the available information, and (b) it is readily usable by MLalgorithms. We propose Repo2Vec, a comprehensive embedding approach to represent a repository as a distributed vector by combining features from three types of information sources. As our key novelty, we consider three types of information: (a)metadata, (b) the structure of the repository, and (c) the source code. We also introduce a series of embedding approaches to represent and combine these information types into a single embedding. We evaluate our method with two real datasets from GitHub for a combined 1013 repositories. First, we show that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of precision (93%vs 78%), with nearly twice as many Strongly Similar repositories and 30% fewer False Positives. Second, we show how Repo2Vecprovides a solid basis for: (a) distinguishing between malware and benign repositories, and (b) identifying a meaningful hierarchical clustering. For example, we achieve 98% precision and 96%recall in distinguishing malware and benign repositories. Overall, our work is a fundamental building block for enabling many repository analysis functions such as repository categorization by target platform or intention, detecting code-reuse and clones, and identifying lineage and evolution.

> Malware detection and analysis are active research subjects in cybersecurity over the last years. Indeed, the development of obfuscation techniques, as packing, for example, requires special attention to detect recent variants of malware. The usual detection methods do not necessarily provide tools to interpret the results. Therefore, we propose a model based on the transformation of binary files into grayscale image, which achieves an accuracy rate of 88%. Furthermore, the proposed model can determine if a sample is packed or encrypted with a precision of 85%. It allows us to analyze results and act appropriately. Also, by applying attention mechanisms on detection models, we have the possibility to identify which part of the files looks suspicious. This kind of tool should be very useful for data analysts, it compensates for the lack of interpretability of the common detection models, and it can help to understand why some malicious files are undetected.

> Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays important role in personalized advertising and recommender systems. Though many models have been proposed such as FM, FFM and DeepFM in recent years, feature engineering is still a very important way to improve the model performance in many applications because using raw features can rarely lead to optimal results. For example, the continuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new feature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature. However, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience and it is both time consuming and labor consuming. On the other side, concise CTR model with both fast online serving speed and good model performance is critical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose LeafFM model based on FM to generate new features from the original feature embedding by learning the transformation functions automatically. We also design three concrete Leaf-FM models according to the different strategies of combing the original and the generated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets and the results show Leaf-FM model outperforms standard FMs by a large margin. Compared with FFMs, Leaf-FM can achieve significantly better performance with much less parameters. In Avazu and Malware dataset, add version Leaf-FM achieves comparable performance with some deep learning based models such as DNN and AutoInt. As an improved FM model, Leaf-FM has the same computation complexity with FM in online serving phase and it means Leaf-FM is applicable in many industry applications because of its better performance and high computation efficiency.

> In the recent years, Portable Document Format, commonly known as PDF, has become a democratized standard for document exchange and dissemination. This trend has been due to its characteristics such as its flexibility and portability across platforms. The widespread use of PDF has installed a false impression of inherent safety among benign users. However, the characteristics of PDF motivated hackers to exploit various types of vulnerabilities, overcome security safeguards, thereby making the PDF format one of the most efficient malicious code attack vectors. Therefore, efficiently detecting malicious PDF files is crucial for information security. Several analysis techniques has been proposed in the literature, be it static or dynamic, to extract the main features that allow the discrimination of malware files from benign ones. Since classical analysis techniques may be limited in case of zero-days, machine-learning based techniques have emerged recently as an automatic PDF-malware detection method that is able to generalize from a set of training samples. These techniques are themselves facing the challenge of evasion attacks where a malicious PDF is transformed to look benign. In this work, we give an overview on the PDF-malware detection problem. We give a perspective on the new challenges and emerging solutions.

> Delivering malware covertly and evasively is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a new method to covertly and evasively deliver malware through a neural network model. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware in neurons, the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the performance of neural network. Meanwhile, because the structure of the neural network model remains unchanged, it can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded in a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicion is raised by anti-virus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks for attacks becomes a forwarding trend. We hope this work can provide a reference scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks.

> We present MalONT2.0 -- an ontology for malware threat intelligence \cite{rastogi2020malont}. New classes (attack patterns, infrastructural resources to enable attacks, malware analysis to incorporate static analysis, and dynamic analysis of binaries) and relations have been added following a broadened scope of core competency questions. MalONT2.0 allows researchers to extensively capture all requisite classes and relations that gather semantic and syntactic characteristics of an android malware attack. This ontology forms the basis for the malware threat intelligence knowledge graph, MalKG, which we exemplify using three different, non-overlapping demonstrations. Malware features have been extracted from CTI reports on android threat intelligence shared on the Internet and written in the form of unstructured text. Some of these sources are blogs, threat intelligence reports, tweets, and news articles. The smallest unit of information that captures malware features is written as triples comprising head and tail entities, each connected with a relation. In the poster and demonstration, we discuss MalONT2.0, MalKG, as well as the dynamically growing knowledge graph, TINKER.

> Internet of Things devices have seen a rapid growth and popularity in recent years with many more ordinary devices gaining network capability and becoming part of the ever growing IoT network. With this exponential growth and the limitation of resources, it is becoming increasingly harder to protect against security threats such as malware due to its evolving faster than the defence mechanisms can handle with. The traditional security systems are not able to detect unknown malware as they use signature-based methods. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by introducing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis approach using neural network and binary visualisation. The prime motivation of the proposed approach is to faster detect and classify new malware (zero-day malware). The experiment results show that our method can satisfy the accuracy requirement of practical application.

> Supervised Deep Learning requires plenty of labeled data to converge, and hence perform optimally for task-specific learning. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism named DRo (for Deep Routing) for data-scarce domains like security. The DRo approach builds upon some of the recent developments in Deep-Clustering. In particular, it exploits the self-augmented training mechanism using synthetically generated local perturbations. DRo not only allays the challenges with sparse-labeled data but also offers many unique advantages. We also developed a system named DRoID that uses the DRo mechanism for enhancing the performance of an existing Malware Detection System that uses (low information features like the) Android implicit Intent(s) as the only features. We conduct experiments on DRoID using a popular and standardized Android malware dataset and found that the DRo mechanism could successfully reduce the false-alarms generated by the downstream classifier by 67.9%, and also simultaneously boosts its accuracy by 11.3%. This is significant not only because the gains achieved are unparalleled but also because the features used were never considered rich enough to train a classifier on; and hence no decent performance could ever be reported by any malware classification system till-date using these features in isolation. Owing to the results achieved, the DRo mechanism claims a dominant position amongst all known systems that aims to enhance the classification performance of deep learning models with sparse-labeled data.

> Digital investigators often get involved with cases, which seemingly point the responsibility to the person to which the computer belongs, but after a thorough examination malware is proven to be the cause, causing loss of precious time. Whilst Anti-Virus (AV) software can assist the investigator in identifying the presence of malware, with the increase in zero-day attacks and errors that exist in AV tools, this is something that cannot be relied upon. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of malware upon various Windows operating system versions in order to determine and correlate the relationship between malicious software and OS artifacts. This will enable an investigator to be more efficient in identifying the presence of new malware and provide a starting point for further investigation.

> Advanced metamorphic malware and ransomware, by using obfuscation, could alter their internal structure with every attack. If such malware could intrude even into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original malware instance gets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. It is challenging to obtain training data for such evasive malware. Therefore, in this paper, we present ADVERSARIALuscator, a novel system that uses specialized Adversarial-DRL to obfuscate malware at the opcode level and create multiple metamorphic instances of the same. To the best of our knowledge, ADVERSARIALuscator is the first-ever system that adopts the Markov Decision Process-based approach to convert and find a solution to the problem of creating individual obfuscations at the opcode level. This is important as the machine language level is the least at which functionality could be preserved so as to mimic an actual attack effectively. ADVERSARIALuscator is also the first-ever system to use efficient continuous action control capable of deep reinforcement learning agents like the Proximal Policy Optimization in the area of cyber security. Experimental results indicate that ADVERSARIALuscator could raise the metamorphic probability of a corpus of malware by >0.45. Additionally, more than 33% of metamorphic instances generated by ADVERSARIALuscator were able to evade the most potent IDS. If such malware could intrude even into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original malware instance gets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. Hence ADVERSARIALuscator could be used to generate data representative of a swarm of very potent and coordinated AI-based metamorphic malware attacks. The so generated data and simulations could be used to bolster the defenses of an IDS against an actual AI-based metamorphic attack from advanced malware and ransomware.

> The ability to transfer adversarial attacks from one model (the surrogate) to another model (the victim) has been an issue of concern within the machine learning (ML) community. The ability to successfully evade unseen models represents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks. In this work we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an unrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same training data as the victim. We present the first study of transferring adversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under imperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable level of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each model. This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and others. Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with data or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset. This makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other and contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security. We remedy this by developing a masked version of Projected Gradient Descent that simulates class disparity, which enables the attacker to reliably estimate a lower-bound on their attack's success.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are architectures based on Neural Networks that could produce successful adversarial samples. The interest towards this technology is quickly growing. In this paper, we propose a system that produces a feature vector for making an Android malware strongly evasive and then modify the malicious program accordingly. Such a system could have a twofold contribution: it could be used to generate datasets to validate systems for detecting GAN-based malware and to enlarge the training and testing dataset for making more robust malware classifiers.

> Motivated by the transformative impact of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various domains, researchers and anti-virus vendors have proposed DNNs for malware detection from raw bytes that do not require manual feature engineering. In this work, we propose an attack that interweaves binary-diversification techniques and optimization frameworks to mislead such DNNs while preserving the functionality of binaries. Unlike prior attacks, ours manipulates instructions that are a functional part of the binary, which makes it particularly challenging to defend against. We evaluated our attack against three DNNs in white- and black-box settings, and found that it often achieved success rates near 100%. Moreover, we found that our attack can fool some commercial anti-viruses, in certain cases with a success rate of 85%. We explored several defenses, both new and old, and identified some that can foil over 80% of our evasion attempts. However, these defenses may still be susceptible to evasion by attacks, and so we advocate for augmenting malware-detection systems with methods that do not rely on machine learning.

> Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples (AEs) with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. However, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic AEs in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Finally, we present robustness certification utilizing non-uniform perturbation bounds, and show that non-uniform bounds achieve better certification.

> Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks. However, most of them cannot provide an interpretation for their classification results. Machine learning models that are interpretable are usually linear or piecewise linear and yield inferior performance. Non-linear models achieve much better classification performance, but it is hard to interpret their classification results. This may have been changed by an interpretable feedforward neural network (IFFNN) proposed that achieves both high classification performance and interpretability for malware detection. If the IFFNN can perform well in a more flexible and general form for other classification tasks while providing meaningful interpretations, it may be of great interest to the applied machine learning community. In this paper, we propose a way to generalize the interpretable feedforward neural network to multi-class classification scenarios and any type of feedforward neural networks, and evaluate its classification performance and interpretability on intrinsic interpretable datasets. We conclude by finding that the generalized IFFNNs achieve comparable classification performance to their normal feedforward neural network counterparts and provide meaningful interpretations. Thus, this kind of neural network architecture has great practical use.

> AI methods have been proven to yield impressive performance on Android malware detection. However, most AI-based methods make predictions of suspicious samples in a black-box manner without transparency on models' inference. The expectation on models' explainability and transparency by cyber security and AI practitioners to assure the trustworthiness increases. In this article, we present a novel model-agnostic explanation method for AI models applied for Android malware detection. Our proposed method identifies and quantifies the data features relevance to the predictions by two steps: i) data perturbation that generates the synthetic data by manipulating features' values; and ii) optimization of features attribution values to seek significant changes of prediction scores on the perturbed data with minimal feature values changes. The proposed method is validated by three experiments. We firstly demonstrate that our proposed model explanation method can aid in discovering how AI models are evaded by adversarial samples quantitatively. In the following experiments, we compare the explainability and fidelity of our proposed method with state-of-the-arts, respectively.

> With the growing number of malware and cyber attacks, there is a need for "orthogonal" cyber defense approaches, which are complementary to existing methods by detecting unique malware samples that are not predicted by other methods. In this paper, we propose a novel and orthogonal malware detection (OMD) approach to identify malware using a combination of audio descriptors, image similarity descriptors and other static/statistical features. First, we show how audio descriptors are effective in classifying malware families when the malware binaries are represented as audio signals. Then, we show that the predictions made on the audio descriptors are orthogonal to the predictions made on image similarity descriptors and other static features. Further, we develop a framework for error analysis and a metric to quantify how orthogonal a new feature set (or type) is with respect to other feature sets. This allows us to add new features and detection methods to our overall framework. Experimental results on malware datasets show that our approach provides a robust framework for orthogonal malware detection.

> Detection of malicious activities in corporate environments is a very complex task and much effort has been invested into research of its automation. However, vast majority of existing methods operate only in a narrow scope which limits them to capture only fragments of the evidence of malware's presence. Consequently, such approach is not aligned with the way how the cyber threats are studied and described by domain experts. In this work, we discuss these limitations and design a detection framework which combines observed events from different sources of data. Thanks to this, it provides full insight into the attack life cycle and enables detection of threats that require this coupling of observations from different telemetries to identify the full scope of the incident. We demonstrate applicability of the framework on a case study of a real malware infection observed in a corporate network.

> Deep Learning (DL)-based malware detectors are increasingly adopted for early detection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity. However, their sensitivity to adversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal language model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to malware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte sequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed method, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a real-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\% evasion rate. MalGPT enables cybersecurity researchers to develop advanced defense capabilities by emulating large-scale realistic AMG.

> Sparse events, such as malign attacks in real-time network traffic, have caused big organisations an immense hike in revenue loss. This is due to the excessive growth of the network and its exposure to a plethora of people. The standard methods used to detect intrusions are not promising and have significant failure to identify new malware. Moreover, the challenges in handling high volume data with sparsity, high false positives, fewer detection rates in minor class, training time and feature engineering of the dimensionality of data has promoted deep learning to take over the task with less time and great results. The existing system needs improvement in solving real-time network traffic issues along with feature engineering. Our proposed work overcomes these challenges by giving promising results using deep-stacked autoencoders in two stages. The two-stage deep learning combines with shallow learning using the random forest for classification in the second stage. This made the model get well with the latest Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity - Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CICIDS-2017) dataset. Zero false positives with admirable detection accuracy were achieved.

> The malware has been being one of the most damaging threats to computers that span across multiple operating systems and various file formats. To defend against the ever-increasing and ever-evolving threats of malware, tremendous efforts have been made to propose a variety of malware detection methods that attempt to effectively and efficiently detect malware. Recent studies have shown that, on the one hand, existing ML and DL enable the superior detection of newly emerging and previously unseen malware. However, on the other hand, ML and DL models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of adversarial examples, which are maliciously generated by slightly and carefully perturbing the legitimate inputs to confuse the targeted models. Basically, adversarial attacks are initially extensively studied in the domain of computer vision, and some quickly expanded to other domains, including NLP, speech recognition and even malware detection. In this paper, we focus on malware with the file format of portable executable (PE) in the family of Windows operating systems, namely Windows PE malware, as a representative case to study the adversarial attack methods in such adversarial settings. To be specific, we start by first outlining the general learning framework of Windows PE malware detection based on ML/DL and subsequently highlighting three unique challenges of performing adversarial attacks in the context of PE malware. We then conduct a comprehensive and systematic review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE malware detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness of PE malware detection. We conclude the paper by first presenting other related attacks against Windows PE malware detection beyond the adversarial attacks and then shedding light on future research directions and opportunities.

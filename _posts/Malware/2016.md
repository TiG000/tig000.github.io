> Modern malware is designed with mutation characteristics, namely polymorphism and metamorphism, which causes an enormous growth in the number of variants of malware samples. Categorization of malware samples on the basis of their behaviors is essential for the computer security community, because they receive huge number of malware everyday, and the signature extraction process is usually based on malicious parts characterizing malware families. Microsoft released a malware classification challenge in 2015 with a huge dataset of near 0.5 terabytes of data, containing more than 20K malware samples. The analysis of this dataset inspired the development of a novel paradigm that is effective in categorizing malware variants into their actual family groups. This paradigm is presented and discussed in the present paper, where emphasis has been given to the phases related to the extraction, and selection of a set of novel features for the effective representation of malware samples. Features can be grouped according to different characteristics of malware behavior, and their fusion is performed according to a per-class weighting paradigm. The proposed method achieved a very high accuracy ($\approx$ 0.998) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset.

> Combating malware is very important for software/systems security, but to prevent the software/systems from the advanced malware, viz. metamorphic malware is a challenging task, as it changes the structure/code after each infection. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel approach to detect the advanced malware with high accuracy by analyzing the occurrence of opcodes (features) by grouping the executables. These groups are made on the basis of our earlier studies [1] that the difference between the sizes of any two malware generated by popular advanced malware kits viz. PS-MPC, G2 and NGVCK are within 5 KB. On the basis of obtained promising features, we studied the performance of thirteen classifiers using N-fold cross-validation available in machine learning tool WEKA. Among these thirteen classifiers we studied in-depth top five classifiers (Random forest, LMT, NBT, J48 and FT) and obtain more than 96.28% accuracy for the detection of unknown malware, which is better than the maximum detection accuracy (95.9%) reported by Santos et al (2013). In these top five classifiers, our approach obtained a detection accuracy of 97.95% by the Random forest.

> The metamorphic malware variants with the same malicious behavior (family), can obfuscate themselves to look different from each other. This variation in structure leads to a huge signature database for traditional signature matching techniques to detect them. In order to effective and efficient detection of malware in large amounts of executables, we need to partition these files into groups which can identify their respective families. In addition, the grouping criteria should be chosen such a way that, it can also be applied to unknown files encounter on computers for classification. This paper discusses the study of malware and benign executables in groups to detect unknown malware with high accuracy. We studied sizes of malware generated by three popular second generation malware (metamorphic malware) creator kits viz. G2, PS-MPC and NGVCK, and observed that the size variation in any two generated malware from same kit is not much. Hence, we grouped the executables on the basis of malware sizes by using Optimal k-Means Clustering algorithm and used these obtained groups to select promising features for training (Random forest, J48, LMT, FT and NBT) classifiers to detect variants of malware or unknown malware. We find that detection of malware on the basis of their respected file sizes gives accuracy up to 99.11% from the classifiers.

<summary>2016-06-29 01:05:36 - subgraph2vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Rooted Sub-graphs from Large Graphs</summary>

- *Annamalai Narayanan, Mahinthan Chandramohan, Lihui Chen, Yang Liu, Santhoshkumar Saminathan*

- `1606.08928v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08928v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08928v1)

> In this paper, we present subgraph2vec, a novel approach for learning latent representations of rooted subgraphs from large graphs inspired by recent advancements in Deep Learning and Graph Kernels. These latent representations encode semantic substructure dependencies in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models for tasks such as graph classification, clustering, link prediction and community detection. subgraph2vec leverages on local information obtained from neighbourhoods of nodes to learn their latent representations in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs, SVMs and relational data clustering algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies. Also, we show that the subgraph vectors could be used for building a deep learning variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Our experiments on several benchmark and large-scale real-world datasets reveal that subgraph2vec achieves significant improvements in accuracies over existing graph kernels on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically, on two realworld program analysis tasks, namely, code clone and malware detection, subgraph2vec outperforms state-of-the-art kernels by more than 17% and 4%, respectively.

<summary>2016-07-27 15:32:18 - N-opcode Analysis for Android Malware Classification and Categorization</summary>

- *BooJoong Kang, Suleiman Y. Yerima, Kieran McLaughlin, Sakir Sezer*

- `1607.08149v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08149v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08149v1)

> Malware detection is a growing problem particularly on the Android mobile platform due to its increasing popularity and accessibility to numerous third party app markets. This has also been made worse by the increasingly sophisticated detection avoidance techniques employed by emerging malware families. This calls for more effective techniques for detection and classification of Android malware. Hence, in this paper we present an n-opcode analysis based approach that utilizes machine learning to classify and categorize Android malware. This approach enables automated feature discovery that eliminates the need for applying expert or domain knowledge to define the needed features. Our experiments on 2520 samples that were performed using up to 10-gram opcode features showed that an f-measure of 98% is achievable using this approach.

> Mobile malware has continued to grow at an alarming rate despite on-going efforts towards mitigating the problem. This has been particularly noticeable on Android due to its being an open platform that has subsequently overtaken other platforms in the share of the mobile smart devices market. Hence, incentivizing a new wave of emerging Android malware sophisticated enough to evade most common detection methods. This paper proposes and investigates a parallel machine learning based classification approach for early detection of Android malware. Using real malware samples and benign applications, a composite classification model is developed from parallel combination of heterogeneous classifiers. The empirical evaluation of the model under different combination schemes demonstrates its efficacy and potential to improve detection accuracy. More importantly, by utilizing several classifiers with diverse characteristics, their strengths can be harnessed not only for enhanced Android malware detection but also quicker white box analysis by means of the more interpretable constituent classifiers.

> In this paper, we present an operational system for cyber threat intelligence gathering from various social platforms on the Internet particularly sites on the darknet and deepnet. We focus our attention to collecting information from hacker forum discussions and marketplaces offering products and services focusing on malicious hacking. We have developed an operational system for obtaining information from these sites for the purposes of identifying emerging cyber threats. Currently, this system collects on average 305 high-quality cyber threat warnings each week. These threat warnings include information on newly developed malware and exploits that have not yet been deployed in a cyber-attack. This provides a significant service to cyber-defenders. The system is significantly augmented through the use of various data mining and machine learning techniques. With the use of machine learning models, we are able to recall 92% of products in marketplaces and 80% of discussions on forums relating to malicious hacking with high precision. We perform preliminary analysis on the data collected, demonstrating its application to aid a security expert for better threat analysis.

<summary>2016-10-06 17:50:27 - DeepDGA: Adversarially-Tuned Domain Generation and Detection</summary>

- *Hyrum S. Anderson, Jonathan Woodbridge, Bobby Filar*

- `1610.01969v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01969v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01969v1)

> Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish command and control (C&C) connections. While there are many methods to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat blind to new DGA variants.   In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect. In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, our deep learning architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector + generator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve convergence.

<summary>2016-11-02 20:34:56 - Predicting Domain Generation Algorithms with Long Short-Term Memory Networks</summary>

- *Jonathan Woodbridge, Hyrum S. Anderson, Anjum Ahuja, Daniel Grant*

- `1611.00791v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00791v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00791v1)

> Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results.

<summary>2016-12-02 19:00:50 - A Survey of Stealth Malware: Attacks, Mitigation Measures, and Steps Toward Autonomous Open World Solutions</summary>

- *Ethan M. Rudd, Andras Rozsa, Manuel Günther, Terrance E. Boult*

- `1603.06028v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06028v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06028v2)

> As our professional, social, and financial existences become increasingly digitized and as our government, healthcare, and military infrastructures rely more on computer technologies, they present larger and more lucrative targets for malware. Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains.

> Android malware has been on the rise in recent years due to the increasing popularity of Android and the proliferation of third party application markets. Emerging Android malware families are increasingly adopting sophisticated detection avoidance techniques and this calls for more effective approaches for Android malware detection. Hence, in this paper we present and evaluate an n-gram opcode features based approach that utilizes machine learning to identify and categorize Android malware. This approach enables automated feature discovery without relying on prior expert or domain knowledge for pre-determined features. Furthermore, by using a data segmentation technique for feature selection, our analysis is able to scale up to 10-gram opcodes. Our experiments on a dataset of 2520 samples showed an f-measure of 98% using the n-gram opcode based approach. We also provide empirical findings that illustrate factors that have probable impact on the overall n-gram opcodes performance trends.

> The Android operating system has become the most popular operating system for smartphones and tablets leading to a rapid rise in malware. Sophisticated Android malware employ detection avoidance techniques in order to hide their malicious activities from analysis tools. These include a wide range of anti-emulator techniques, where the malware programs attempt to hide their malicious activities by detecting the emulator. For this reason, countermeasures against antiemulation are becoming increasingly important in Android malware detection. Analysis and detection based on real devices can alleviate the problems of anti-emulation as well as improve the effectiveness of dynamic analysis. Hence, in this paper we present an investigation of machine learning based malware detection using dynamic analysis on real devices. A tool is implemented to automatically extract dynamic features from Android phones and through several experiments, a comparative analysis of emulator based vs. device based detection by means of several machine learning algorithms is undertaken. Our study shows that several features could be extracted more effectively from the on-device dynamic analysis compared to emulators. It was also found that approximately 24% more apps were successfully analysed on the phone. Furthermore, all of the studied machine learning based detection performed better when applied to features extracted from the on-device dynamic analysis.

<summary>2017-04-08 13:10:50 - A Multi-view Context-aware Approach to Android Malware Detection and Malicious Code Localization</summary>

- *Annamalai Narayanan, Mahinthan Chandramohan, Lihui Chen, Yang Liu*

- `1704.01759v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01759v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01759v2)

> Existing Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.   MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view. Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides multi-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g., methods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets (incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localisation experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify all the malice classes with 94% average recall.

- *A. Gomez Ramirez, M. Martinez Pedreira, C. Grigoras, L. Betev, C. Lara, U. Kebschull*

- `1704.04782v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04782v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04782v1)

> High Energy Physics (HEP) distributed computing infrastructures require automatic tools to monitor, analyze and react to potential security incidents. These tools should collect and inspect data such as resource consumption, logs and sequence of system calls for detecting anomalies that indicate the presence of a malicious agent. They should also be able to perform automated reactions to attacks without administrator intervention. We describe a novel framework that accomplishes these requirements, with a proof of concept implementation for the ALICE experiment at CERN. We show how we achieve a fully virtualized environment that improves the security by isolating services and Jobs without a significant performance impact. We also describe a collected dataset for Machine Learning based Intrusion Prevention and Detection Systems on Grid computing. This dataset is composed of resource consumption measurements (such as CPU, RAM and network traffic), logfiles from operating system services, and system call data collected from production Jobs running in an ALICE Grid test site and a big set of malware. This malware was collected from security research sites. Based on this dataset, we will proceed to develop Machine Learning algorithms able to detect malicious Jobs.

> Artificial intelligence methods have often been applied to perform specific functions or tasks in the cyber-defense realm. However, as adversary methods become more complex and difficult to divine, piecemeal efforts to understand cyber-attacks, and malware-based attacks in particular, are not providing sufficient means for malware analysts to understand the past, present and future characteristics of malware.   In this paper, we present the Malware Analysis and Attributed using Genetic Information (MAAGI) system. The underlying idea behind the MAAGI system is that there are strong similarities between malware behavior and biological organism behavior, and applying biologically inspired methods to corpora of malware can help analysts better understand the ecosystem of malware attacks. Due to the sophistication of the malware and the analysis, the MAAGI system relies heavily on artificial intelligence techniques to provide this capability. It has already yielded promising results over its development life, and will hopefully inspire more integration between the artificial intelligence and cyber--defense communities.

<summary>2017-07-11 09:15:46 - A Survey on Resilient Machine Learning</summary>

- *Atul Kumar, Sameep Mehta*

> Machine learning based system are increasingly being used for sensitive tasks such as security surveillance, guiding autonomous vehicle, taking investment decisions, detecting and blocking network intrusion and malware etc. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models are venerable to attacks by adversaries at all phases of machine learning (eg, training data collection, training, operation). All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing down the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned mode, or causing the system make error(s) only in attacker's planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners. We present a survey of this emerging area in machine learning.

<summary>2017-09-11 13:19:08 - A Planning Approach to Monitoring Behavior of Computer Programs</summary>

- *Alexandre Cukier, Ronen I. Brafman, Yotam Perkal, David Tolpin*

- `1709.03363v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03363v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03363v1)

> We describe a novel approach to monitoring high level behaviors using concepts from AI planning. Our goal is to understand what a program is doing based on its system call trace. This ability is particularly important for detecting malware. We approach this problem by building an abstract model of the operating system using the STRIPS planning language, casting system calls as planning operators. Given a system call trace, we simulate the corresponding operators on our model and by observing the properties of the state reached, we learn about the nature of the original program and its behavior. Thus, unlike most statistical detection methods that focus on syntactic features, our approach is semantic in nature. Therefore, it is more robust against obfuscation techniques used by malware that change the outward appearance of the trace but not its effect. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating it on actual system call traces.

<summary>2017-09-13 08:38:36 - On labeling Android malware signatures using minhashing and further classification with Structural Equation Models</summary>

- *Ignacio Martín, José Alberto Hernández, Sergio de los Santos*

- `1709.04186v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04186v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04186v1)

> Multi-scanner Antivirus systems provide insightful information on the nature of a suspect application; however there is often a lack of consensus and consistency between different Anti-Virus engines. In this article, we analyze more than 250 thousand malware signatures generated by 61 different Anti-Virus engines after analyzing 82 thousand different Android malware applications. We identify 41 different malware classes grouped into three major categories, namely Adware, Harmful Threats and Unknown or Generic signatures. We further investigate the relationships between such 41 classes using community detection algorithms from graph theory to identify similarities between them; and we finally propose a Structure Equation Model to identify which Anti-Virus engines are more powerful at detecting each macro-category. As an application, we show how such models can help in identifying whether Unknown malware applications are more likely to be of Harmful or Adware type.

<summary>2017-09-21 18:17:36 - Learning Domain-Specific Word Embeddings from Sparse Cybersecurity Texts</summary>

- *Arpita Roy, Youngja Park, SHimei Pan*

- `1709.07470v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07470v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07470v1)

> Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that automatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an embedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the performance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Syntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When the input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g., cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In this pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddings from sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leverages diverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semantic relations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encode diverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novel Word Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of text annotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on two cybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific word embeddings.

<summary>2017-11-03 22:49:49 - Decentralised firewall for malware detection</summary>

- *Saurabh Raje, Shyamal Vaderia, Neil Wilson, Rudrakh Panigrahi*

- `1711.01353v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01353v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01353v1)

> This paper describes the design and development of a decentralized firewall system powered by a novel malware detection engine. The firewall is built using blockchain technology. The detection engine aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as malicious or benign. File classification is carried out using a deep belief neural network (DBN) as the detection engine. Our approach is to model the files as grayscale images and use the DBN to classify those images into the aforementioned two classes. An extensive data set of 10,000 files is used to train the DBN. Validation is carried out using 4,000 files previously unexposed to the network. The final result of whether to allow or block a file is obtained by arriving at a proof of work based consensus in the blockchain network.

<summary>2017-11-16 05:37:14 - Enhanced Attacks on Defensively Distilled Deep Neural Networks</summary>

- *Yujia Liu, Weiming Zhang, Shaohua Li, Nenghai Yu*

- `1711.05934v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05934v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05934v1)

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many tasks of machine learning, such as the image classification. Unfortunately, researchers have shown that DNNs are easily attacked by adversarial examples, slightly perturbed images which can mislead DNNs to give incorrect classification results. Such attack has seriously hampered the deployment of DNN systems in areas where security or safety requirements are strict, such as autonomous cars, face recognition, malware detection. Defensive distillation is a mechanism aimed at training a robust DNN which significantly reduces the effectiveness of adversarial examples generation. However, the state-of-the-art attack can be successful on distilled networks with 100% probability. But it is a white-box attack which needs to know the inner information of DNN. Whereas, the black-box scenario is more general. In this paper, we first propose the epsilon-neighborhood attack, which can fool the defensively distilled networks with 100% success rate in the white-box setting, and it is fast to generate adversarial examples with good visual quality. On the basis of this attack, we further propose the region-based attack against defensively distilled DNNs in the black-box setting. And we also perform the bypass attack to indirectly break the distillation defense as a complementary method. The experimental results show that our black-box attacks have a considerable success rate on defensively distilled networks.

<summary>2017-12-12 17:39:33 - Android Malware Characterization using Metadata and Machine Learning Techniques</summary>

- *Ignacio Martín, José Alberto Hernández, Alfonso Muñoz, Antonio Guzmán*

- `1712.04402v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04402v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04402v1)

> Android Malware has emerged as a consequence of the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets. While most previous work focuses on inherent characteristics of Android apps to detect malware, this study analyses indirect features and meta-data to identify patterns in malware applications. Our experiments show that: (1) the permissions used by an application offer only moderate performance results; (2) other features publicly available at Android Markets are more relevant in detecting malware, such as the application developer and certificate issuer, and (3) compact and efficient classifiers can be constructed for the early detection of malware applications prior to code inspection or sandboxing.

- *ElMouatez Billah Karbab, Mourad Debbabi, Abdelouahid Derhab, Djedjiga Mouheb*

- `1712.08996v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08996v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08996v1)

> Android OS experiences a blazing popularity since the last few years. This predominant platform has established itself not only in the mobile world but also in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This popularity, however, comes at the expense of security, as it has become a tempting target of malicious apps. Hence, there is an increasing need for sophisticated, automatic, and portable malware detection solutions. In this paper, we propose MalDozer, an automatic Android malware detection and family attribution framework that relies on sequences classification using deep learning techniques. Starting from the raw sequence of the app's API method calls, MalDozer automatically extracts and learns the malicious and the benign patterns from the actual samples to detect Android malware. MalDozer can serve as a ubiquitous malware detection system that is not only deployed on servers, but also on mobile and even IoT devices. We evaluate MalDozer on multiple Android malware datasets ranging from 1K to 33K malware apps, and 38K benign apps. The results show that MalDozer can correctly detect malware and attribute them to their actual families with an F1-Score of 96%-99% and a false positive rate of 0.06%-2%, under all tested datasets and settings.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the traditional Internet, which allows a very large number of smart devices, such as home appliances, network cameras, sensors and controllers to connect to one another to share information and improve user experiences. Current IoT devices are typically micro-computers for domain-specific computations rather than traditional functionspecific embedded devices. Therefore, many existing attacks, targeted at traditional computers connected to the Internet, may also be directed at IoT devices. For example, DDoS attacks have become very common in IoT environments, as these environments currently lack basic security monitoring and protection mechanisms, as shown by the recent Mirai and Brickerbot IoT botnets. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight approach for detecting DDos malware in IoT environments.We firstly extract one-channel gray-scale images converted from binaries, and then utilize a lightweight convolutional neural network for classifying IoT malware families. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve 94.0% accuracy for the classification of goodware and DDoS malware, and 81.8% accuracy for the classification of goodware and two main malware families.

> Android devices are growing exponentially and are connected through the internet accessing billion of online websites. The popularity of these devices encourages malware developer to penetrate the market with malicious apps to annoy and disrupt the victim. Although, for the detection of malicious apps different approaches are discussed. However, proposed approaches are not suffice to detect the advanced malware to limit/prevent the damages. In this, very few approaches are based on opcode occurrence to classify the malicious apps. Therefore, this paper investigates the five classifiers using opcodes occurrence as the prominent features for the detection of malicious apps. For the analysis, we use WEKA tool and found that FT detection accuracy (79.27%) is best among the investigated classifiers. However, true positives rate i.e. malware detection rate is highest (99.91%) by RF and fluctuate least with the different number of prominent features compared to other studied classifiers. The analysis shows that overall accuracy is majorly affected by the false positives of the classifier.

<summary>2018-05-19 19:27:36 - NtMalDetect: A Machine Learning Approach to Malware Detection Using Native API System Calls</summary>

- *Chan Woo Kim*

- `1802.05412v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05412v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05412v2)

> As computing systems become increasingly advanced and as users increasingly engage themselves in technology, security has never been a greater concern. In malware detection, static analysis, the method of analyzing potentially malicious files, has been the prominent approach. This approach, however, quickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the capabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious functions, making static analysis extremely difficult for newer variants. The approach assessed in this paper is a novel dynamic malware analysis method, which may generalize better than static analysis to newer variants. Inspired by recent successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), widely used document classification techniques were assessed in detecting malware by doing such analysis on system calls, which contain useful information about the operation of a program as requests that the program makes of the kernel. Features considered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious programs, and the task to classify these traces is treated as a binary document classification task of system call traces. The system call traces were processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function names. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This paper shows that Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) optimized by Stochastic Gradient Descent and the traditional Coordinate Descent on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM are effective in this approach, achieving a highest of 96% accuracy with 95% recall score. Additional contributions include the identification of significant system call sequences that could be avenues for further research.

<summary>2018-06-28 02:28:18 - Robust Neural Malware Detection Models for Emulation Sequence Learning</summary>

- *Rakshit Agrawal, Jack W. Stokes, Mady Marinescu, Karthik Selvaraj*

- `1806.10741v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10741v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10741v1)

> Malicious software, or malware, presents a continuously evolving challenge in computer security. These embedded snippets of code in the form of malicious files or hidden within legitimate files cause a major risk to systems with their ability to run malicious command sequences. Malware authors even use polymorphism to reorder these commands and create several malicious variations. However, if executed in a secure environment, one can perform early malware detection on emulated command sequences.   The models presented in this paper leverage this sequential data derived via emulation in order to perform Neural Malware Detection. These models target the core of the malicious operation by learning the presence and pattern of co-occurrence of malicious event actions from within these sequences. Our models can capture entire event sequences and be trained directly using the known target labels. These end-to-end learning models are powered by two commonly used structures - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Previously proposed sequential malware classification models process no more than 200 events. Attackers can evade detection by delaying any malicious activity beyond the beginning of the file. We present specialized models that can handle extremely long sequences while successfully performing malware detection in an efficient way. We present an implementation of the Convoluted Partitioning of Long Sequences approach in order to tackle this vulnerability and operate on long sequences. We present our results on a large dataset consisting of 634,249 file sequences, with extremely long file sequences.

<summary>2018-07-05 01:23:11 - Using LIP to Gloss Over Faces in Single-Stage Face Detection Networks</summary>

- *Siqi Yang, Arnold Wiliem, Shaokang Chen, Brian C. Lovell*

- `1712.08263v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08263v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08263v2)

> This work shows that it is possible to fool/attack recent state-of-the-art face detectors which are based on the single-stage networks. Successfully attacking face detectors could be a serious malware vulnerability when deploying a smart surveillance system utilizing face detectors. We show that existing adversarial perturbation methods are not effective to perform such an attack, especially when there are multiple faces in the input image. This is because the adversarial perturbation specifically generated for one face may disrupt the adversarial perturbation for another face. In this paper, we call this problem the Instance Perturbation Interference (IPI) problem. This IPI problem is addressed by studying the relationship between the deep neural network receptive field and the adversarial perturbation. As such, we propose the Localized Instance Perturbation (LIP) that uses adversarial perturbation constrained to the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) of a target to perform the attack. Experiment results show the LIP method massively outperforms existing adversarial perturbation generation methods -- often by a factor of 2 to 10.

- `1807.08265v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08265v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08265v1)

> Current malware detection and classification approaches generally rely on time consuming and knowledge intensive processes to extract patterns (signatures) and behaviors from malware, which are then used for identification. Moreover, these signatures are often limited to local, contiguous sequences within the data whilst ignoring their context in relation to each other and throughout the malware file as a whole. We present a Deep Learning based malware classification approach that requires no expert domain knowledge and is based on a purely data driven approach for complex pattern and feature identification.

> We investigate a Deep Learning based system for malware detection. In the investigation, we experiment with different combination of Deep Learning architectures including Auto-Encoders, and Deep Neural Networks with varying layers over Malicia malware dataset on which earlier studies have obtained an accuracy of (98%) with an acceptable False Positive Rates (1.07%). But these results were done using extensive man-made custom domain features and investing corresponding feature engineering and design efforts. In our proposed approach, besides improving the previous best results (99.21% accuracy and a False Positive Rate of 0.19%) indicates that Deep Learning based systems could deliver an effective defense against malware. Since it is good in automatically extracting higher conceptual features from the data, Deep Learning based systems could provide an effective, general and scalable mechanism for detection of existing and unknown malware.

<summary>2018-09-16 14:40:16 - Comparison of Deep Learning and the Classical Machine Learning Algorithm for the Malware Detection</summary>

> Recently, Deep Learning has been showing promising results in various Artificial Intelligence applications like image recognition, natural language processing, language modeling, neural machine translation, etc. Although, in general, it is computationally more expensive as compared to classical machine learning techniques, their results are found to be more effective in some cases. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated and compared one of the Deep Learning Architecture called Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the classical Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for the malware classification. We studied the performance of the classical RF and DNN with 2, 4 & 7 layers architectures with the four different feature sets, and found that irrespective of the features inputs, the classical RF accuracy outperforms the DNN.

> Progressively intricate cyber infiltration mechanisms have made conventional means of defense, such as firewalls and malware detectors, incompetent. These sophisticated infiltration mechanisms can study the defender's behavior, identify security caveats, and modify their actions adaptively. To tackle these security challenges, cyber-infrastructures require active defense techniques that incorporate cyber deception, in which the defender (deceiver) implements a strategy to mislead the infiltrator. To this end, we use a two-player partially observable stochastic game (POSG) framework, wherein the deceiver has full observability over the states of the POSG, and the infiltrator has partial observability. Then, the deception problem is to compute a strategy for the deceiver that minimizes the expected cost of deception against all strategies of the infiltrator. We first show that the underlying problem is a robust mixed-integer linear program, which is intractable to solve in general. Towards a scalable approach, we compute optimal finite-memory strategies for the infiltrator by a reduction to a series of synthesis problems for parametric Markov decision processes. We use these infiltration strategies to find robust strategies for the deceiver using mixed-integer linear programming. We illustrate the performance of our technique on a POSG model for network security. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach handles scenarios considerably larger than those of the state-of-the-art methods.

<summary>2018-11-07 22:30:38 - Efficient Formal Safety Analysis of Neural Networks</summary>

- *Shiqi Wang, Kexin Pei, Justin Whitehouse, Junfeng Yang, Suman Jana*

- `1809.08098v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08098v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08098v3)

> Neural networks are increasingly deployed in real-world safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and malware detection. However, these networks have been shown to often mispredict on inputs with minor adversarial or even accidental perturbations. Consequences of such errors can be disastrous and even potentially fatal as shown by the recent Tesla autopilot crash. Thus, there is an urgent need for formal analysis systems that can rigorously check neural networks for violations of different safety properties such as robustness against adversarial perturbations within a certain $L$-norm of a given image. An effective safety analysis system for a neural network must be able to either ensure that a safety property is satisfied by the network or find a counterexample, i.e., an input for which the network will violate the property. Unfortunately, most existing techniques for performing such analysis struggle to scale beyond very small networks and the ones that can scale to larger networks suffer from high false positives and cannot produce concrete counterexamples in case of a property violation. In this paper, we present a new efficient approach for rigorously checking different safety properties of neural networks that significantly outperforms existing approaches by multiple orders of magnitude. Our approach can check different safety properties and find concrete counterexamples for networks that are 10$\times$ larger than the ones supported by existing analysis techniques. We believe that our approach to estimating tight output bounds of a network for a given input range can also help improve the explainability of neural networks and guide the training process of more robust neural networks.

<summary>2018-11-15 10:47:38 - R2-D2: ColoR-inspired Convolutional NeuRal Network (CNN)-based AndroiD Malware Detections</summary>

- *TonTon Hsien-De Huang, Hung-Yu Kao*

- `1705.04448v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04448v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04448v5)

> The influence of Deep Learning on image identification and natural language processing has attracted enormous attention globally. The convolution neural network that can learn without prior extraction of features fits well in response to the rapid iteration of Android malware. The traditional solution for detecting Android malware requires continuous learning through pre-extracted features to maintain high performance of identifying the malware. In order to reduce the manpower of feature engineering prior to the condition of not to extract pre-selected features, we have developed a coloR-inspired convolutional neuRal networks (CNN)-based AndroiD malware Detection (R2-D2) system. The system can convert the bytecode of classes.dex from Android archive file to rgb color code and store it as a color image with fixed size. The color image is input to the convolutional neural network for automatic feature extraction and training. The data was collected from Jan. 2017 to Aug 2017. During the period of time, we have collected approximately 2 million of benign and malicious Android apps for our experiments with the help from our research partner Leopard Mobile Inc. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system has accurate security analysis on contracts. Furthermore, we keep our research results and experiment materials on http://R2D2.TWMAN.ORG.

<summary>2018-11-21 12:14:12 - Inline Detection of Domain Generation Algorithms with Context-Sensitive Word Embeddings</summary>

- *Joewie J. Koh, Barton Rhodes*

- `1811.08705v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08705v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08705v1)

> Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are frequently employed by malware to generate domains used for connecting to command-and-control (C2) servers. Recent work in DGA detection leveraged deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and character-level long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to classify domains. However, these classifiers perform poorly with wordlist-based DGA families, which generate domains by pseudorandomly concatenating dictionary words. We propose a novel approach that combines context-sensitive word embeddings with a simple fully-connected classifier to perform classification of domains based on word-level information. The word embeddings were pre-trained on a large unrelated corpus and left frozen during the training on domain data. The resulting small number of trainable parameters enabled extremely short training durations, while the transfer of language knowledge stored in the representations allowed for high-performing models with small training datasets. We show that this architecture reliably outperformed existing techniques on wordlist-based DGA families with just 30 DGA training examples and achieved state-of-the-art performance with around 100 DGA training examples, all while requiring an order of magnitude less time to train compared to current techniques. Of special note is the technique's performance on the matsnu DGA: the classifier attained a 89.5% detection rate with a 1:1,000 false positive rate (FPR) after training on only 30 examples of the DGA domains, and a 91.2% detection rate with a 1:10,000 FPR after 90 examples. Considering that some of these DGAs have wordlists of several hundred words, our results demonstrate that this technique does not rely on the classifier learning the DGA wordlists. Instead, the classifier is able to learn the semantic signatures of the wordlist-based DGA families.

<summary>2018-11-25 10:21:59 - Is Data Clustering in Adversarial Settings Secure?</summary>

- *Battista Biggio, Ignazio Pillai, Samuel Rota Bulò, Davide Ariu, Marcello Pelillo, Fabio Roli*

- `1811.09982v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09982v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09982v1)

> Clustering algorithms have been increasingly adopted in security applications to spot dangerous or illicit activities. However, they have not been originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that may aim to subvert the clustering process itself. Whether clustering can be safely adopted in such settings remains thus questionable. In this work we propose a general framework that allows one to identify potential attacks against clustering algorithms, and to evaluate their impact, by making specific assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, and capabilities of manipulating the input data. We show that an attacker may significantly poison the whole clustering process by adding a relatively small percentage of attack samples to the input data, and that some attack samples may be obfuscated to be hidden within some existing clusters. We present a case study on single-linkage hierarchical clustering, and report experiments on clustering of malware samples and handwritten digits.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have witnessed as a powerful approach in this year by solving long-standing Artificial intelligence (AI) supervised and unsupervised tasks exists in natural language processing, speech processing, computer vision and others. In this paper, we attempt to apply DNNs on three different cyber security use cases: Android malware classification, incident detection and fraud detection. The data set of each use case contains real known benign and malicious activities samples. The efficient network architecture for DNN is chosen by conducting various trails of experiments for network parameters and network structures. The experiments of such chosen efficient configurations of DNNs are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate set in the range [0.01-0.5]. Experiments of DNN performed well in comparison to the classical machine learning algorithms in all cases of experiments of cyber security use cases. This is due to the fact that DNNs implicitly extract and build better features, identifies the characteristics of the data that lead to better accuracy. The best accuracy obtained by DNN and XGBoost on Android malware classification 0.940 and 0.741, incident detection 1.00 and 0.997 fraud detection 0.972 and 0.916 respectively.

<summary>2018-12-23 03:44:03 - A Cross-Architecture Instruction Embedding Model for Natural Language Processing-Inspired Binary Code Analysis</summary>

- *Kimberly Redmond, Lannan Luo, Qiang Zeng*

- `1812.09652v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09652v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09652v1)

> Given a closed-source program, such as most of proprietary software and viruses, binary code analysis is indispensable for many tasks, such as code plagiarism detection and malware analysis. Today, source code is very often compiled for various architectures, making cross-architecture binary code analysis increasingly important. A binary, after being disassembled, is expressed in an assembly languages. Thus, recent work starts exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) inspired binary code analysis. In NLP, words are usually represented in high-dimensional vectors (i.e., embeddings) to facilitate further processing, which is one of the most common and critical steps in many NLP tasks. We regard instructions as words in NLP-inspired binary code analysis, and aim to represent instructions as embeddings as well.   To facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, our goal is that similar instructions, regardless of their architectures, have embeddings close to each other. To this end, we propose a joint learning approach to generating instruction embeddings that capture not only the semantics of instructions within an architecture, but also their semantic relationships across architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on building cross-architecture instruction embedding model. As a showcase, we apply the model to resolving one of the most fundamental problems for binary code similarity comparison---semantics-based basic block comparison, and the solution outperforms the code statistics based approach. It demonstrates that it is promising to apply the model to other cross-architecture binary code analysis tasks.

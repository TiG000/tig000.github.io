> As smartphones become more pervasive, they are increasingly targeted by malware. At the same time, each new generation of smartphone features increasingly powerful onboard sensor suites. A new strain of sensor malware has been developing that leverages these sensors to steal information from the physical environment (e.g., researchers have recently demonstrated how malware can listen for spoken credit card numbers through the microphone, or feel keystroke vibrations using the accelerometer). Yet the possibilities of what malware can see through a camera have been understudied. This paper introduces a novel visual malware called PlaceRaider, which allows remote attackers to engage in remote reconnaissance and what we call virtual theft. Through completely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors, PlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments. Remote burglars can thus download the physical space, study the environment carefully, and steal virtual objects from the environment (such as financial documents, information on computer monitors, and personally identifiable information). Through two human subject studies we demonstrate the effectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual theft platforms, and we suggest several possible defenses against visual malware.

> Smartphone technology is more and more becoming the predominant communication tool for people across the world. People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread so do the security threats and vulnerabilities facing this technology. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. Since smartphones are devices which change their network location as the user moves between different places, intrusion detection systems for smartphone technology are most often classified as IDSs designed for mobile ad-hoc networks. The aim of this research is to give a brief overview of IDS technology, give an overview of major machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms used in IDS technologies, give an overview of security models of iOS and Android and propose a new host-based IDS model for smartphones and create proof-of-concept application for Android platform for the newly proposed model. Keywords: IDS, SVM, Android, iOS;

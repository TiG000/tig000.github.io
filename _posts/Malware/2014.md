> Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.

> The use of short text messages in social media and instant messaging has become a popular communication channel during the last years. This rising popularity has caused an increment in messaging threats such as spam, phishing or malware as well as other threats. The processing of these short text message threats could pose additional challenges such as the presence of lexical variants, SMS-like contractions or advanced obfuscations which can degrade the performance of traditional filtering solutions. By using a real-world SMS data set from a large telecommunications operator from the US and a social media corpus, in this paper we analyze the effectiveness of machine learning filters based on linguistic and behavioral patterns in order to detect short text spam and abusive users in the network. We have also explored different ways to deal with short text message challenges such as tokenization and entity detection by using text normalization and substring clustering techniques. The obtained results show the validity of the proposed solution by enhancing baseline approaches.

<summary>2014-08-27 15:14:11 - Knowledge Engineering for Planning-Based Hypothesis Generation</summary>

> In this paper, we address the knowledge engineering problems for hypothesis generation motivated by applications that require timely exploration of hypotheses under unreliable observations. We looked at two applications: malware detection and intensive care delivery. In intensive care, the goal is to generate plausible hypotheses about the condition of the patient from clinical observations and further refine these hypotheses to create a recovery plan for the patient. Similarly, preventing malware spread within a corporate network involves generating hypotheses from network traffic data and selecting preventive actions. To this end, building on the already established characterization and use of AI planning for similar problems, we propose use of planning for the hypothesis generation problem. However, to deal with uncertainty, incomplete model description and unreliable observations, we need to use a planner capable of generating multiple high-quality plans. To capture the model description we propose a language called LTS++ and a web-based tool that enables the specification of the LTS++ model and a set of observations. We also proposed a 9-step process that helps provide guidance to the domain expert in specifying the LTS++ model. The hypotheses are then generated by running a planner on the translated LTS++ model and the provided trace. The hypotheses can be visualized and shown to the analyst or can be further investigated automatically.
